# Android App Tetris

This Tetris game was created with the Android Studio environment, written in Java. The project was developed during my third year of studies, for the Android Development course. Due to size limitations, the project has been uploaded on Dropbox, and is available for download at the link below:

I followed the work of the Github user _@v-grishechko_, and I adapted and extended the available code with the following features:
- Added a local database and a register/login system for users
- Homepage menu 
- Hall of Fame which outputs the highscores of all users registered in the database
- Manage profile options (change password, delete account ... more to follow)
- Implemented a microtransaction system in which the user has to spend coins to replenish lives and play further. Only five lives are available at the beginning which are slowly recharging over time. Coins can be acquired during gameplay
